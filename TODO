* pdf doc made from latex is ugly.

* automatically select viewer program and workable settings
  depending on what is installed. Currently, no xpdf simple 
  causes an error and it is not clear how to get gv to work.

* also it seems gv with examples is broken. gv tries to open
  the wrong file, and other problems. Other bugs when switching
  between gv and xpdf.

* the test suite needs to be fixed. hence all the reintroduced bugs.
